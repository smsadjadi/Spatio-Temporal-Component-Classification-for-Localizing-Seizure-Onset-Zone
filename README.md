# Spatio-Temporal Component Classification for Localizing Seizure Onset Zone
Non-invasive localization of epileptic foci needs an intelligent analysis of resting-state brain data in search of the interictal epileptogenic activity for which STCC is presented. The paper for this study is under review, and its preprint will be publically available soon.
